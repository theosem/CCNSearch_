Dependencies:
- ccnx-0.2.0 . We didn't test it with the newer versions of ccnx but we plan to do it.

- Lire library (http://www.semanticmetadata.net/lire/) for CEDD image descriptor.
- javaml library (for the kdtree indexer)

Usage:
In the scripts folder there are some scripts that start the needed services and applications
Please before using them set the appropriate paths and jar names as needed.


1. first run startccn to start:
	 fileProxy (available in ccnx.org releases)
	SearchProxy
	ccnd
This should be done in every node of the CCN network where you will search.

2. run monitor 
	This will start inotify's wait and will watch for changes in a folder (If the user drops an image in this folder the software should start searching inside CCN for similar images)

3. killccn kills the sevices
